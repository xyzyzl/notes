# 2020 AMC 12A Final Ten
15. Basic complex number wrangling
16. Overlap with AMC 10, just look at single squares
17. Could use trapezoid riemann sums or shoelace
18. Coordbash I solved in contest (AMC 10)
19. (AMC 10) Consider $2^17$ as one power
20. (AMC 10) Casework isn't that hard to execute
21. Prime factorize $5!$ and $10!$ and compare $n$ accordingly
22. Geometric series with complex numbers. Not hard but super bashy
23. (AMC 10) Really hard combo question. We're given some dice rolls and want to find the probability that someone can score 7 after rerolling a subset
24. Easy geo, just rotate $\triangle ABC$ around $60^\circ$ and do some basic Law of Cosines. probably an early-mid AIME problem
25. gaaaaaah i hate this. basically needed to set $x$ to a value between $1$ and $2$, then try. also note that if $x$ works then $mx$ works as long as the fractional part doesn't carry back. so we need to find the maximum amount such that this works. the sum for all values would then have to be $420$. plug in $m$ and done
