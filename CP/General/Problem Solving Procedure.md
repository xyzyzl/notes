# Problem Solving Procedure
## Analyzing the Method
- Read through the problem carefully and find things
- Work through the sample test data and try to solve the problem.
	- Sometimes the samples are trivial and there is nothing to work on, but still try to work on them
- Make observations on key properties that may propel to a solution
- Then read the question constraints and try to find a correct running speed for a possible algorithm
	- Sometimes questions become too hard when constraints are high but are easy when constraints are low.
- Think in all methods (not just one).
		- BFS vs DFS
		- If one method is too hard think of another one.
		- Charts are friends
## Implementation
- Mostly need to write pseudocode during the analysis to speed the process up
	- Make a list of things you need to do in order to solve the problem
	- Also I've had a few times where I've had an idea and it just disappeared; just write the details down.
- Then also need to like find an appropriate DS or template algorithm to base your solution off of
- Then find a way to use this algorithm to solve the question.
	- Use methods from the algorithm, such as segmenttree.update() or smth
