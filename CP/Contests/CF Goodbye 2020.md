# CF Goodbye 2020
- Solved A and B quickly without any trouble
- Got stuck on C for a bit, got WA
- Solved D without much difficulty
- Went back to C
	- Got obsessed over - delta and didn't think clearly
	- Also got stuck over some wrong ideas
- Went to E
	- Got stuck into some wrong idea (but still had some correct things)
	- E ended up being really easy but I managed getting screwed over still
	- Tried solving by bits but that didn't work; parts of the solution were used in the actual sol.
### Analysis
- On C
	- Didn't think about any alternatives after getting the wrong answer, always thought about pushing my current method forward and/or escaping to another problem. 
	- Also make sure to **NOT** think about rating because rating is basically useless during the contest anyways.
	- Delete CF-Predictor or disable during contest because it's a distraction. Jump to problems through the quick navigator to ignore the number of people that solved the problem.
- On E
	- Got trapped in some thoughts that were complete quackery
	- Need to think about other possible ways to do the problem and how to fix any issues that may have come up instead of thinking "oh no I can't do this I surrender" or something.
	- Also panic over - delta seems to have clouded my judgment here as well. Why am I so bad at this?
