# USACO Summary
1. Problem name: Replication, Method: BFS
	1. flirted around with some ideas, including that the only valid ending nodes for the initial robot were nodes such that $D_s \leq D_r$, where $D_s$ is the distance from a starting node and $D_r$ is the distance from a rock
	2. could not work around some implementation details, ran out of time and just went for the first 5 test cases
	3. overall score: 5/20
2. Problem name: Bovine Genetics, Method: DP??
	1. not totally sure how to do what the question asked. tried a brute force but it didn't work so I just went for samples
	2. overall score: 2/20
3. Problem name: Square Pasture, Method: sweepline
	1. Went for the first partial because it was very doable
	2. Tried to optimize for the second partial but there were some insurmountable implementation details
	3. Had some idea for an AC solution but again the same implementation issues persisted.
	4. overall score: 5/20

Total score: **200**
Generally feel like the issue this time was more with implementation details
